# User Guide for Functional Language Interpreter

## Introduction
This project is a functional language interpreter focused on lambda expressions and function definitions. It is designed to interpret simple functional programs without variable assignments or mutable state.

---

## Running the System

The system operates in two modes:

1. **Interactive Mode (REPL)** – You can enter commands line by line and get immediate results.
2. **Program Mode** – Run complete programs stored in `.lambda` files. Each command will be executed, and its result printed after execution.

## System Components

### 1. **Lexer**
The Lexer is responsible for tokenizing the source code. Tokens include arithmetic operators, boolean operators, parentheses, function names, and values. The Lexer also handles whitespace and comments.

**Usage:**
Simply input source code, and it will tokenize the code. For example:
```python
x > 3 && y < 5
```
will be tokenized into: `x`, `>`, `3`, `&&`, `y`, `<`, `5`.

### 2. **Parser**
The Parser builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the Lexer. This tree represents the logical structure of the code and allows for its execution according to the language rules.

**Usage:**
The Parser uses the BNF to define the language and parse function definitions, lambda expressions, and comparisons.
```python
factorial(5)
```
is parsed into an AST representing the function call `factorial` with the argument 5.

### 3. **Interpreter**
The Interpreter evaluates the AST generated by the Parser. It supports function applications, including anonymous and recursive functions, as well as arithmetic and boolean operators.

**Usage:**
To run the interpreter:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

factorial(5)
```
Output: `120`

### 4. **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**
The REPL is an interactive interface that allows users to enter commands and get immediate feedback. It is a convenient tool for development and quick testing of code.

**Usage:**
To start the REPL, simply run the system in interactive mode and begin entering commands:
```bash
> 3 + 4
7
> factorial(5)
120
```

## Examples

### Function Definition and Execution:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(3, 4)
```
Output: `7`

### Lambda Expression:
```python
(lambda x: x * 2)(5)
```
Output: `10`

### Boolean Operators:
```python
(3 > 2) && (5 < 10)
```
Output: `True`

---

## Error Handling
The system includes error handling mechanisms that report syntax errors, type errors, and runtime errors. For example, if you enter an invalid expression:
```python
3 / 0
```
you will receive an error: `Division by zero error`.

---

## Testing the System
A Test Suite is included to verify the functionality of all core components. You can run the tests using the provided test files (e.g., `TestParser.py`, `TestInterpreter.py`).

---

## Conclusion
our functional language interpreter allows us to execute functional code easily, build anonymous functions, and run recursive expressions. The REPL provides a convenient tool for real-time development and testing, and the test suite ensures accurate output and reliability.
