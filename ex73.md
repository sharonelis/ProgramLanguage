
Lazy evaluation:
----------------
Lazy evaluation is a programming technique where values are only computed when they are needed, rather than being evaluated immediately upon their definition. This contrasts with eager evaluation, where all values are calculated as soon as they are encountered, regardless of whether they are used right away.

In Python, lazy evaluation is often implemented using generators, where values are produced one at a time and only when explicitly requested.

Function generate_values:
This function is a generator. When called, it doesn't immediately generate all values. Instead, it returns a generator object, which yields values one by one as needed.

Function square:
This function prints the number it is squaring and returns the squared value.
The print statements help us observe when the function is actually called, illustrating the difference between eager and lazy evaluation.
